The code is about to implement a digital access control with a correct code
“26A05” and it operates at 2 modes which are daytime and night. At daytime the
door opens when pressing “O” or entering the complete correct code or pressing
“O” in the middle between any digit of the correct code and at the night it only
opens if the code is correct otherwise the alarm has to be triggered.
